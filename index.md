# Welcome to Elsa's Manifesto

My name is Elsa, I am from Seattle, Washington, and I am a Senior Computer Science Major at WPI. I am mostly interesting in front-end computing, which is why I took the 2018 B Term Human Computer Interaction class. Here are a 4 of the projects I completed in this class, as well as a refelction of all the projects that I did in total.
